# Stocks-Analysis

Overview of Project: 
Analyze the dataset that contains stock market ticker symbols over the last few years, to reduce the time it takes to execute larger data. The data is being analyzed for Steve. Initially he wanted to analyze a specific stock ticker (DQ).  After presenting the data he also wanted to share the research with his parents. While sharing with his parents he also wants to include the entire stock market. Which meant refactoring the code that I had previously written.

Results of Data:
After analyzing the data to compare the stock performances between the years 2017 and 2018.  I did this by examining the execution times of the scipt. 
The 2017 results showed that the returns for all tickers except (TERP) had positive returns.

The 2018 data showed that all but 2 tickers (ENPH) and (RUN) had negative returns.

There were also significant changes in the total daily volume when comparing year to year. 

In summary there are both advantages and disadvantages for refactoring code. One of the advantages I observed is not being required to memorize code or adding new functions.  The disadvantage I found the need to make sure the code and spelling of code matches from module to module to help with multiple debugging errors. 
The pros of refactoring is being able to copy the code to make it more efficient than the original code. The cons are that refactoring will most likely start with code that was written by someone else and you have to become familiar with the orignal code.
